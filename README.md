# FormSubmissionApp
Run app in browser and input in text fields and submit. 
The submission saves name and surname to formdata.json in the solution.
There's validations and 2 unit tests. I have also used asynchronous programming, dependency injections, SOLID for best practices in MVC.
The app is built using ASP.NET MVC and C#
